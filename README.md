# simple-smart-contract-app
Called "Smart Contract App", it is an application that aims to interact with smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can connect to the application and send data to smart contracts using their MetaMask wallet.

The application interacts with a smart contract that represents a specific address on the Ethereum network to which the user is connected. This smart contract is an example of a contract identified by the name "SimpleStorage".

The main functions of the application include sending data to and receiving data from the contract. Users can send data to the contract and get the current value of the contract using a text input through the application's interface. These transactions are carried out through the "set" and "get" functions of smart contracts.

The app also tracks the user's connection status with their MetaMask wallet and gives the user the option to disconnect.

The goal of this project is to develop an application that offers users the ability to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
